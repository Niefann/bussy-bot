I am the tallest of mountains
I am the roughest of waves
I am the toughest of terrors
I am the darkest of days
I'm the last one that's standing
Don't try to stand in my way
'Cause I've been up against better
Just take a look at my face
'Cause If you're messing with me
I am a dangerous weapon
I am the sharpest of blades
I'll cut you down in a second
'Cause I was born in this pain
It only hurts if you let it
So if you think you can take me
Then you should go and forget it
And after all this time, you're back for more
(I won't stop until they know my name)
So I'll take what's mine and start this war
(I'm coming at you like a tidal wave)
When everything you know has come and gone
(You are at your lowest, I am rising higher)
Only scars remain of who I was
(What I find in the ashes, you lose in the fire!)
When there's no one left to carry on
(This is an illusion, open up your eyes and...)
The pain persist
I can't resist
But that's what it takes to be Infinite
So look around you
And tell me what you really see
I never end
And that's the difference in you and me
Cause when your time is up
And everything is falling down
It's only me and you - who is gonna save you now?
So look around you
And tell me what you really see
You live a lie
And that's the difference in you and me
I have the power
Let me show you what it's all about
It's only me and you - who is gonna save you now?
